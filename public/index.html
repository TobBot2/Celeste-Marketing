        <h1>Chinese Pantheon</h1>
        <div id="general" class="container">
            <p>Chinese mythology has been around for thousands of years – even before the first unified dynasties that came about in 220 BCE. Myths were seen as true histories of their people and were often used to legitimize authority. Emperors would often claim to have a “mandate of Heaven,” or a godly right to rule the land. </p>
            <p>Having invented paper, they have depictions of many gods that are still around along with writings accompanying them. In addition to drawings, there are bamboo scrolls typically inscribed with writing but sometimes with art instead. There are also many dedicated temples and monuments to specific gods.</p>
            <p>Myths were widespread throughout China and were heavily influenced by three fundamental philosophies – Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.</p>
            <p>Confucianism is a philosophy first thought up by Confucius during his life from 551 BCE to 479 BCE. It focuses on community: Respecting elders and leading by example. These philosophies even govern modern-day Chinese culture, imposing norms like the eldest son caring for the other siblings and being formal when speaking to elders – even friends only a few years older.</p>
            <p>Taoism (or Daoism) is a religion that focuses on the philosophy of equilibrium and detachment from the physical to achieve great vitality, longevity, and intelligence. Tao (道) translates to “method” or “way” and Jiao (教) translates to “teach.” It is the Taoists’ belief that everything in the universe has flowing energy and is therefore constantly changing. This flowing energy is called ‘chi’. Taoists learn to not interfere with this natural, harmonic flow. Instead, they become one with it to understand and adapt to the universe, thus achieving the vitality and longevity they strive for. One famous icon of Taoist beliefs is the yin-yang symbol. This symbol represents how the universe changes – hence the swirling and mixing nature of it – but also how the universe is balanced – hence the equal parts of black and white. </p>
            <p>Buddhism, which originated in India, heavily influenced Chinese mythology. In fact, the Buddha himself appears in famous myths such as Journey to the West. This was in large part to the silk road, a trading route integral to the development of nations technologically, but as a side effect also a place where cultures would interact, spreading and remixing religions in the process. Because it travelled to a different culture, it changed a lot during that journey too. Though most elements remain unchanged, many elements of Taoism were incorporated. This means that in addition to worshipping the Buddha, they worshipped many Taoist gods too. Another stark difference is in the depiction of the Buddha. In his original story, he achieved Enlightenment by meditating under a tree. He sat there without eating for seven weeks, so naturally he became very thin. In China, the most popular depiction of him is as a large, fat man sitting and smiling. This depiction is of the laughing Buddha, or the Budai, who represents the main goal in life: being happy.</p>

            <h2>Impact on Chinese Culture</h2>
            <p>There are many animals that are gods such as Monkey, the Dragon King, and Nu Gua. This puts a different value on animal life than many other cultures where the only gods look like humans. </p>
            <p>Buddhism was not introduced to China with Journey to the West, but given the themes of the story, it significantly increased its popularity. Wu Cheng’en’s focus on the strength of Buddhist characters and even the conversion to Buddhism in the case of Monkey, it is clear this story was written with a bias towards Buddhism. Even the Jade Emperor, the Taoist God and ruler of Heaven, Earth and the Underworld, is constantly in need of help – even from the Buddha himself. </p>
